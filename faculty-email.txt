SUBJECT: Action Required: New Federal Live Captioning Requirements

Dear Colleagues,

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    COMPLIANCE DEADLINE: April 24, 2026
    New federal ADA regulations require live captions
    for all synchronous online instruction
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Starting Spring 2026, ALL faculty teaching live online courses must enable real-time captioning. This is no longer optional or provided only upon request—it's a legal requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title II.


WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
─────────────────────

• Proactive, Not Reactive: Captions must be available for ALL live sessions, regardless of whether any student has requested accommodations

• Speaker Identification Required: Captions must make clear who is speaking, especially in discussions

• Applies to All Live Content: Every synchronous Zoom session in your online or hybrid courses


IMMEDIATE ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE THIS WEEK
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Turn on Zoom auto-captions — Click "Live Transcript" → "Enable Auto-Transcription"

2. Update your Zoom display name — Include your role (e.g., "Dr. Smith - Instructor")

3. Use student names — When calling on students, say their names clearly

4. Repeat questions — "Thanks Sarah, you're asking about the deadline..."

We've created a comprehensive guide with step-by-step instructions, best practices, FAQs, and an interactive checklist:

WHY THIS MATTERS
────────────────

Beyond legal compliance, captions benefit ALL students. Research shows:

• 98.6% of students who use captions say they're helpful
• 75% use captions as a learning aid
• 52% report improved comprehension

Captions help deaf/hard of hearing students, ESL learners, students in noisy environments, and those who learn better with text reinforcement.


SUPPORT AVAILABLE
─────────────────

For Spring 2026, the college is providing enhanced captioning services through the California DECT Grant, which covers live captioning for courses that need additional support beyond Zoom's auto-captions.
